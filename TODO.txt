generic class proxies with non-generic protected methods:
	invocation type creates the delegate to call the method on target inline in InvokeMethodOnTarget()
	since the method is non-generic it should cache the delegate in static .ctor, like non-generic proxies do

GenericMap
	adding map overrides existing value. This can happen for class proxies with callback methods for example.
	Rework it so we avoid duplicates and throw if a duplicate happens.
